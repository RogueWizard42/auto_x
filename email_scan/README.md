# Email Scan Automation

This script scans a file of email addresses, extracts those containing the string "old" using regex, and saves them in a new list.

## How It Works
1. Reads an input file containing a list of emails.
2. Uses regex to filter emails containing "old".
3. Writes the filtered emails to an output file.

## Setup & Usage
(TBD - Will be updated as the project develops)
